This game's concept is aeronaval battles on a planet. This occurred because I am tired of playing games which force me to the edge of a map; real modern battles span the world, with limited over-the-horizon ranges of vision, but capability to strike far away with silver bullet assets like fast jets.

My vision for this project is slow growth over a while until a complete game is made for my accomplishment and amusement. My goal for now is to implement basic naval battles, and have them networked for online play eventually. In the long run, I'd like to experiment with monetizing extra vehicles (in the range of $2-5 per vehicle), but not the base game.
