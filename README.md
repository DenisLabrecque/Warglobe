Unity airplane and ship simulation on a planetary sphere.

My vision for this project is slow growth over a while until a complete game is made for my accomplishment and amusement. My goal for now is to implement basic naval battles, and have them networked for online play eventually. In the long run, I'd like to experiment with monetizing extra vehicles (in the range of $2-5 per vehicle), but not the base game.
